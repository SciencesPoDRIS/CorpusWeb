    <h3>Purpose of the corpus</h3>
    <span>Give an account of links between the different world actors working on and around the issue of climate change, through the network of web sites formed with <a title="médialab Hyphe" href="http://hyphe.medialab.sciences-po.fr/" target="_blank">Hyphe</a>.<br/><br/>Corpus indexing involved a team of 8 people:<br/>1 referent researcher who gives relevant indexing criteria in order to explore thoroughly the results and "make the corpus speak". He helps to determine categories and related values.<br/>7 indexing librarians and information scientists including 1 referent on climate change.<br/>Tools used: <a title="médialab Hyphe" href="http://hyphe.medialab.sciences-po.fr/" target="_blank">Hyphe</a>, <a title="Google Sheets" href="http://www.google.com/sheets/about/" target="_blank">Google Sheets</a>, <a title="Gephi" href="https://gephi.github.io/" target="_blank">Gephi</a>, <a title="Sigma" href="http://sigmajs.org/" target="_blank">Sigma</a></span>
    <h3>Selection</h3>
    <span>The starting point for the selection of sites for the corpus of COP21 actors was an article - <i>Three maps and three Misunderstandings: A digital mapping of climate diplomacy</i> <sup>1</sup> - published in 2014 in Big Data & Society by Tommaso Venturini (et al .). In this article, T. Venturini highlights thematic clusters through co-occurrence <a href="http://www.medialab.sciences-po.fr/publications/misunderstandings/" target="_blank">mapping</a> of terms on climate change from a corpus of texts from the Earth Negotiations Bulletin (ENB). ENB is a journal of the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) which has published daily reports on United Nations negotiations on environment and development since 1995.<br/>The clusters identified by the map have been renamed manually by the authors in order to group terms by families and thus represent the main lines of work of these climate negotiations. 12 themes emerged: Fuels and transportation sector; Clean development mechanism; Environmental and social impacts; Energy and technology transfer; Vulnerability and adaptation; GHGs emission; Kyoto Protocol; Funding and equity; Compliance and enforcement; REDD / REDD + and post-Kyoto; Land use and forests; Models and IPCC. To start the corpus, the team chose to select sites in relation to each theme. Thus, 3-4 sites per subject were identified using Google search engine. 39 first sites (Starting point) were selected making the corpus “core”.<br/><br/>Regarding corpus sites language, two options were initially considered: a multilingual corpus including the three languages ​​of international climate negotiations (COP) - French, English, Spanish - or an English monolingual corpus.<br/>Given the potential size of the corpus (several thousand sites), human resources and the short time deadline, the choice was to select only sites in English and to provide for a search interface only in English . For “boundary” sites (see Boundary indexing), however, sites in other languages ​​than English will be kept.<br/>Other exclusion criteria were established to select the sites and to limit the corpus. Thus were left aside wiki, PDF files, search engines, general media sites or social network platforms like Facebook or Twitter, because they are too large sites to crawl and of no interest for the initial issue.</span>
    <h3>Indexing</h3>
    <span>Indexing is to choose which sites digged by the crawl will be considered for the corpus and to categorize them. Indexing the corpus was done in four stages: first a test phase followed by 3 proper indexing phases.<br/>The test corpus allows to try out indexing criteria, to determine which ones will be relevant to the full analysis of the network and to check the homogeneity of the indexers work . The test phase was conducted on a sample of 68 sites (45 core corpus sites + 23 sites from a first crawl).<br/>Following this phase, a new core corpus was established (53 sites). A first crawl (depth 2) was performed followed by 2 others (depth 1). Each time, indexers worked on the most cited sites (top rank) to determine the sites to keep and to crawl (In), those to keep, but not to crawl in order to determine the perimeter of the corpus (Boundary) and those not to be kept because of no connection to the issue (content delivery platforms, mainstream media ...) (Out).<br/><br/>The purpose of these successive crawls is to better delimit the network by digging new sites and increasing the weight of quotation. Thus, a site that has been quoted many times in the first crawl can see its "quoted value" go down dramaticaly in subsequent crawls, because it is less cited in the enlarged corpus and vice versa.<br/>The limit between top rank and a priori excluded websites was arbitrarily chosen (time deadline) but based on previous experience on other corpus. Thus, only the sites that were cited at least 9 times were browsed.<br/>When the list of corpus sites and its boundaries is decided on, the indexing phase, strictly speaking, begins.<br/><br/>As of May 28, 2015, only the type of actor has been determined.<br/>The indexing criteria planed for Autumn 2015 are subsequently: site title, type of actor, producing country, geographical area of ​​interest, human role in climate change, type of actions (mitigation, adaptation).</span>
